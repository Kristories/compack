# Compack

[WIP] Composer package generator.

## Installation

```bash
composer global require devtical/compack
```

Make sure to place Composer's system-wide vendor bin directory in your `$PATH` so the compack executable can be located by your system. This directory exists in different locations based on your operating system; however, some common locations include:

- macOS: `$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin`
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Composer\vendor\bin`
- GNU / Linux Distributions: `$HOME/.config/composer/vendor/bin` or `$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin`

You could also find the composer's global installation path by running `composer global about` and looking up from the first line.

## Usage

Once installed, the `compack new` command will create a new package in the directory you specify.

```bash
â–¶ compack new
